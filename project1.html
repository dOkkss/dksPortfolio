          The aim of this design was to enhance ad navigation and streamline the
          process of inserting ads into the service. This was achieved by
          implementing UI changes, making it quicker and more efficient with
          fewer clicks required to accomplish the same goal.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The background is a project where we were tasked with coming up with a
          concept related to recycling or reusing. I chose to focus on
          preschools, as it's a cause I'm deeply passionate about after working
          in the field for over 15 years. I was aware from the start that there
          was a similar concept in Gothenburg City, but I wanted to make it
          easier for those working in preschools to use the service. The primary
          focus was to reduce the time it took to post ads and make it simpler
          to book them.
        </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          During my interviews, a consistent sentiment emerged: dissatisfaction
          with the previous design and a general frustration with its usability.
          There was a unanimous desire for an actual app to enhance day-to-day
          usage. Therefore, my focus in the design process was to streamline ad
          insertion and improve its visual appeal.
